// We define the public class Main to start the program
public class Main { // This brace opens our class block

  // We introduce the main method to run the program 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This brace opens our main method block

        // We print our first line
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java");

        // We print our second line
        System.out.println("Welcome to Computer Science");

        // We print our third line
        System.out.println("Programming is fun");

    } // This brace closes the main method block

} // This brace closes the class block

// And that's all folks!
